## Some difference between interface and type in typescript 


* Interface can be declared multiple time.
* Type  cannot be redeclare with the same name. 
* Interface: Use extends to inharit from other interface. 
* Type: Use &(intersection) to combine multiple types.
* Interface: Best for defining object shape specially when working with classes or large structure. 
* Type: More flexible. when we use union, tuple, function
ETC
